\newthought{I would like to acknowledge} those helped me with my research, those who enabled me to participate in academia, and those who inspired my work on this topic.

\newthought{Thank you to Dr. Adam Graham-Squire} for dealing with my incessant struggles throughout this entire year. From my lack of research experience, my discovery of dead-ends in my first semester topic, and my personal life struggles, you always saw the potential in me.

\newthought{Thank you to my parents} for funding my undergraduate education. We all know it is exorbitant in price, and secretly wish I had gone to an in-state public university. Oops, too late now.

\newthought{Thank you to the Democratic and Republican parties} for having such awful primary voting systems such that I felt a duty to work on a solution to the present failures. Democracy deserves better.
