Ranked Choice is an alternative voting method to our current Plurality model in the U.S., the former trending towards some support for moderate and third-party candidates. However, with every voting method comes limitations and inherent candidate features that are favorable. In this paper, I propose two augmentations to Ranked Choice, along with how to combine them, that have the potential to mitigate some of the issues in relation to fairness criteria anomalies and large field elections. Although much of this paper is comprised of proofs that my augmentations can fail nearly all of the most commonly used fairness criteria, the parameters to achieve such have thus far been impractical and would never be used in a serious election, and conversions between the voting methods demonstrate where these failures arise and how they are inherited. Given reasonable parameters, I will demonstrate with real election data that these method adjustments can aid in selecting a reasonable victor.
